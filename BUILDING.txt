Building SGCraft
--------------------

1. Unpack the SG Craft source distribution or clone it from github.

2. In the SG Craft source directory, do:

   gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies
   gradlew build

3. (Optional) If eclipse will be used, run:
   gradlew eclipse

   Note that as of 2020-03-08, launching the minecraft client or server from
   eclipse will not work with java versions >=openjdk-8.242

The first time you do this, Gradle will download a big pile of stuff. If all
goes well, you should see "Build Successful" and there will be an SGCraft-X-Y.jar
file in the build/libs directory.

After the first successful build, you can add --offline to the gradlew command
to speed up subsequent builds somewhat.
